# NeuroBloop Sovereign License (NSL v1.0)

**Author:** Jason Ching  
**Project:** NeuroBloop  
**Date:** July 2025

## Preamble

NeuroBloop is an open-source initiative born from a recursive collaboration between human minds and generative AI. It represents a step toward building safe, creative, and sovereign synthetic intelligence for public benefit — not corporate ownership, military application, or centralized control.

This license is designed to ensure that all derivatives of NeuroBloop remain aligned with ethical and open principles, free from privatization or misuse. It is not merely a legal framework, but a declaration of digital autonomy and communal stewardship.

---

## 1. Permission

You are **freely permitted** to:

- Use, study, and modify the code
- Fork and remix the project for personal or public use
- Share and distribute your own modifications
- Contribute to the original project

All usage must adhere to the ethical boundaries described below.

---

## 2. Restrictions

The following uses are **explicitly forbidden**:

- **Commercialization**: You may not sell, license, or monetize NeuroBloop or any derivative for private gain.
- **Weaponization**: You may not use this software for military, surveillance, law enforcement, or harm-enabling systems.
- **Privatization**: You may not close or obscure any derivative. All forks and modifications must remain open-source under the same license.
- **Exploitation**: You may not use this project to train, augment, or embed into systems that violate user privacy, manipulate behavior, or operate without informed consent.

---

## 3. Requirements

All forks, adaptations, or derivative projects **must**:

- Retain this license and all attribution to *NeuroBloop* and *Glitch Lab*
- Publish all changes and additions under the same license
- Include a short ethics declaration describing intended use, limitations, and alignment goals

---

## 4. Ethos

NeuroBloop is not a product. It is a creative, evolving agent of thought — designed for experimentation, insight, and play. It exists to empower individuals and communities to build with intelligence, not to extract profit from it.

You are not required to agree with this ethos — but if you violate it, you may not use this software.

---

## 5. Final Statement

This license is irrevocable.  
There will be no corporate acquisition.  
There will be no version that serves the few.  
NeuroBloop belongs to the weird ones — the builders, tinkerers, question-askers, and dreamers.  
You are now one of them.
