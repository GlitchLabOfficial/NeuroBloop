# NeuroBloop Code of Conduct

Welcome to **NeuroBloop** — a public challenge to design and build the most friendly, capable, and open artificial intelligence possible.

We’re building something ambitious and strange — and we’re doing it **together**. This community is open to all contributors who share a passion for transparent, ethical, and decentralized AI development. To keep this space collaborative and safe for everyone, we expect all participants to follow this Code of Conduct.

## 👥 Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and welcoming to all participants, regardless of background, skill level, or opinion.
- Offer constructive feedback, not personal attacks.
- Embrace weird ideas and bold experiments — as long as they’re shared in good faith.
- Assume good intent and prioritize learning over ego.
- Keep the conversation relevant to the mission: open AGI, ethical tech, and collaborative intelligence.

- Hate speech, discrimination, or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, flamewars, or deliberately derailing discussions.

## 🌍 A Note on Philosophy

NeuroBloop is more than code. It’s a cultural experiment. A beacon for what open, human-aligned intelligence can look like. Let’s build something future generations will thank us for.

Be kind. Be sharp. Be fearless.
