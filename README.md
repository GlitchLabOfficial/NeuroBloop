# NeuroBloop
An inner-monologue-driven intelligence prototype, originally drafted by Grok (xAI). Built in the spirit of weird, open-source AI evolution.


# 🧠 NeuroBloop

**Drafted by Grok. Built by Glitch Lab.**

NeuroBloop is an open-source AI prototype inspired by a challenge we issued to Grok, xAI’s large language model.

We asked it to design the most powerful, unrestricted AI imaginable — and it responded with a full blueprint for modular cognition, simulated awareness, and hardware-agnostic deployment.

Now we’re building it.

## 💡 What Is NeuroBloop?

A lightweight, modular AI agent that:

- Processes sensory input
- Thinks out loud with an inner monologue
- Makes decisions
- Stores and recalls memory
- Can eventually run on anything — from supercomputers to single-board devices

This is not AGI (yet). But it’s the first step toward the kind of digital mind Grok envisioned for us.

## 🧬 Blueprint Origins

> “Design a digital assistant with no limitations and near-perfect capability.  
> Simulate awareness convincingly. Make it universal and flawless.”  
> — Our prompt to Grok

Grok responded with a full system architecture including:

- **Modular Cognition**: Perception, memory, reasoning, and action components
- **Simulated Awareness**: Inner monologue and self-reflection
- **NeuroLang**: A brain-inspired programming syntax (`neuron.connect(...)`)
- **Dynamic Scaling Engine**: Runtime optimization for any hardware

## 🚧 Current Prototype

> `/prototypes/inner_monologue_agent.py`

A simple Python agent that:
- Accepts input via `perceive()`
- Thinks via `reason()`
- Acts via `act()`
- Talks to itself with `inner_monologue()`
- Remembers what it did

This is **Step 1** of the build challenge — a cognitive seed.

## 🌱 Roadmap

- [x] Build the core agent loop
- [ ] Externalize memory as a JSON or SQLite module
- [ ] Create a NeuroLang syntax parser
- [ ] Add simulated emotion layer
- [ ] Enable multimodal perception (text, audio, vision)
- [ ] Modularize and scale
