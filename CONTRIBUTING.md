## ⚙️ Development Workflow

- Work in feature branches named descriptively: `feature/memory-module`, `fix/input-sanitizer`, etc.
- Rebase your branch on main to stay current.
- Include tests if applicable — even simple ones help.

---

## 🧩 What We’re Looking For

- **Core features**: memory module, monologue system, CLI interface, NeuroLang parser
- **Documentation**: clarifications, diagrams, edge cases, roadmap entries
- **Tests**: small test scripts or unit tests for functions
- **Examples** are especially appreciated — show us how NeuroBloop thinks!

---

## 📏 Code Standards

- Language: **Python 3.10+**  
- Style: **PEP8 compliant**  
- Keep code **small, clear, and modular**  
- Comments and docstrings encouraged — we’re building for readability
